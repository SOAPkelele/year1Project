A program that automatically downloads the necessary data about patents from www.uspto.gov/

It was written as a course work a year ago during my first year at the university.  


In order to start that program you need to read the description as you may not unsedrtand what you need to download and how everything works. 
But if you really want to jump straight into it, download the file mentioned in the description, rename it to "PGA.txt" and place it into the directory of the main.c file.
